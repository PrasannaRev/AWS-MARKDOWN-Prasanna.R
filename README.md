In the year 2002 [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/?tag=hymsabk-20&ref=pd_sl_6gwjrxu9p1_e&adgrpid=1341405838299434&hvadid=83838130693493&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=143926&hvtargid=kwd-83838874655187:loc-90&hydadcr=28884_11845482&msclkid=5a42acaa3d0e150be8b6ca5cf0ca0a04) launched its first web services from the internal infrastructure that the company built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that provide users with compute, storage and output as needed.

AWS offers many different tools and products for enterprises and software developers in 245 countries and territories. Government agencies, education institutions, nonprofits and private organizations use AWS services.

## Troubleshooting
1) I didn't receive the call from AWS to verify my new account.
If you don't receive the message or call, verify the following: 
• You have entered the correct phone number and selected the correct country code during the sign-up process. 
• If you're using a mobile phone, be sure that you have a cellular signal to receive SMS text messages or calls. 
• The information that you entered for your payment method is correct.
If you didn't receive an SMS text message or call to complete the identity verification process, then reach out to AWS support.
**Note**: You can create a case with AWS Support even if your AWS account isn't activated.

2) I get an error about "maximum number of failed attempts" when I try to verify my AWS account by phone.
